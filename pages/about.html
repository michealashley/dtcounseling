            I have always been fascinated with how and why people behave the way
            they do. I have spent several years determining how listening to others
            can be helpful to their mental health. It is my belief that everyone has
            a story to tell. Feeling listened to is a basic need at its core. During
            my internship in my first master's degree (Forensic Psychology), I learned
            how juveniles in a detention center wanted to feel heard and not be judged
            for their actions. After reviewing a pattern of habitual drug use, I noticed
            how much I wanted to offer my assistance to providing better mental health.

            The end of my first internship led me to a journey of introspection as I
            embarked upon the beginning of my career as a mental health counselor.
            I knew quickly into the beginning of the program that I wanted to work
            with juveniles. I spent my practicum and internship at the Phoenix House
            of the Mid-Atlantic where I could hone my skills of active listening
            and providing clarity fow clients who wanted to know that their issues
            mattered. I provided individual, group, and family therapy for these
            clients. Though a majority of my clients from my internship were youths, I
            see clients from ages 12 - 18, adults, and elderly individuals. I graduated
            from Marymount University in 2016 with a Master of Arts degree in Counseling.
