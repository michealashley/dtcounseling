        As a pre-licensed mental health counselor in my residency, I am unable to 
        take insurance. However, I will work with you financially to provide the 
        care you need because money should never be the reason you do not receive 
        the best care you deserve. If financial strain is problematic, clients can 
        apply for a lifetime membership at <a href="https://openpathcollective.org/clinicians/david-tsveer/">
        Open Path Collective</a> and afterward discuss with me an agreed upon 
        rate per session. For my clients, I provide individual, group, and family 
        therapy at affordable rates. I am able to accept major credit cards, 
        cash, and checks.

    <h2>Group Counseling</h2>
    <p>
        Group sessions allow clients to learn from each other how their lives are challenged 
        and which solutions have helped or hindered them. Clients will take their turn in group 
        and learn new skills via a structured course. Development of self-awareness will occur 
        naturally as clients share their experiences with one another. The group therapy rate is 
        $60 per session.
